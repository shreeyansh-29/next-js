What is Pre-rendering?
Pre-rendering refers to the process of generating HTML with the necessary data for a page in our app.
Pre-rendering can result in better performance and SEO.

React vs Next JS
By default, Next JS pre-renders every page in the application.

What does pre-render mean?
Next JS generates HTML for each page in advance instead of having it all done by client-side JS. 

Pre-rendering Contd.
1. No Pre-rendering (Plain React.js app)
In react app, js is loaded which then executed to mount html elements on DOM.

Initial Load:                       Hydration:
                   JS loads ----->  React components are initialized
App is not rendered                 and App becomes interactive.

2. Pre-rendering (Using Next.js)
In next js, html elements are created on DOM then send to browser. Js then loads and make page interactive.
Initial Load:                       Hydration:
                   JS loads ----->  React components are initialized
Pre-rendered HTML                   and App becomes interactive
is displyed                         

So pre-render means render in advance of sending it to browser.

Why pre-render?
1. Pre-rendering improves performance.
    In a react app, we need to wait for the JS to be executed.
    Perhaps fetch data from an external api and then render the UI.
    There is a wait time for the user.
    With a pre-rendered page, HTMl is already generated and loads faster.

2. Pre-rendering helps with SEO
    With a React app, if the search engine hits your page, it only sees div tag with id equal to root.
    If search engine hits a pre-rendered page though, all the  content is present in the source code which will help index that page and improves performance.
