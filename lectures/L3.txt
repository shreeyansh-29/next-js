Next JS supports two forms of pre-rendering
a. Static Generation
b. Server-side Rendering

Static Generation
A method of pre-rendering where the HTML pages are generated at build time.
The HTML with all the data that makes up the content of the web page are generated in advance when you build your app.
Recommended method to pre-render pages whenever possible.
Page can be build once, cached by CDN and served to the client almost instantly.
Ex- Blog pages, e-commerce product pages, doc and marketing pages.

NOTE: Next-JS pre-render all the page by default.
