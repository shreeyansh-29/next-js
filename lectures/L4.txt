React Server Components(RSC)
It is new Architecture introduced by React team in v18.
The architecture introduces a new way of creating react components, splitting them into two types:

1. Server Components: 
In Next.js, all components are server components by default.
They have the ability to run tasks like reading files or fetching data from a DB.
They don't have the ability to use hooks or handle user interactions;

2. Client Components:
To create a Client component, it's necessary to add "use client" on the top of the component file.
Client components can't perform tasks like reading files, but they have the ability to use hooks and manage interactions. (React Componentss)
